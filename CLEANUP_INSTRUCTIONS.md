# IMPORTANT: Final Cleanup Instructions

## The Issue
There are two empty (0-byte) test files in the root directory that need to be removed:
- `test_simplified.py` (empty)
- `test_live_data.py` (empty)

These files have already been properly moved to the `tests/` folder with their full content.

## Quick Fix (Choose One Method)

### Method 1: Using the Python Script
```bash
cd /Users/jt/magic8/Magic8-Companion
git pull origin main
python scripts/remove_empty_files.py
```

### Method 2: Using the Bash Script
```bash
cd /Users/jt/magic8/Magic8-Companion
git pull origin main
chmod +x scripts/final_cleanup.sh
./scripts/final_cleanup.sh
```

### Method 3: Manual Removal
```bash
cd /Users/jt/magic8/Magic8-Companion
git pull origin main
rm test_simplified.py test_live_data.py
```

## After Any Method Above, Commit the Changes:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Remove empty test files from root - final cleanup"
git push origin main
```

## Verify Success
After pushing, you should see:
- ❌ No `test_simplified.py` in root
- ❌ No `test_live_data.py` in root
- ✅ `tests/test_simplified.py` (with content)
- ✅ `tests/test_live_data.py` (with content)

## Why This Happened
The GitHub API doesn't easily support file deletion through the tools available to me. The empty files were created during the PR merge process. This manual step completes the cleanup.

## After Cleanup is Complete
Run the test suite:
```bash
python scripts/test_runner.py
```

The project will then have the clean structure we want!
