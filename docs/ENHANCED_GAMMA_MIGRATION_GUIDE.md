# Enhanced Gamma Migration Guide

This guide summarizes the work completed to migrate the Enhanced Gamma feature from **MLOptionTrading** into **Magic8-Companion**. It supplements the original migration plan and reflects the status on the `feature/enhanced-gamma-migration` branch.

## Current Status

- Core gamma analysis logic imported from `MLOptionTrading`.
- New `EnhancedGEXWrapper` interfaces with the internal gamma data.
- `gamma_scheduler.py` added for scheduled or continuous analysis runs.
- Initial tests executed but revealed missing log directory creation (fixed in this branch).

## Usage

Run the scheduler from the project root:

```bash
python gamma_scheduler.py --mode scheduled
```

Logs are written to `logs/gamma_scheduler.log`.

## Next Steps

1. Validate results against the original MLOptionTrading implementation.
2. Update documentation as the migration stabilizes.
3. Remove remaining external dependencies.
