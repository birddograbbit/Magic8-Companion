# Magic8-Companion Multi-Strategy Update

## What Changed

As of June 10, 2025, Magic8-Companion now outputs recommendations for **ALL strategies** at each checkpoint, not just the single best one.

## New Output Format

### Before (Single Strategy):
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-06-10T10:30:00Z",
  "checkpoint_time": "10:30 ET",
  "recommendations": {
    "SPX": {
      "preferred_strategy": "Iron_Condor",
      "score": 88.0,
      "confidence": "HIGH",
      "all_scores": {...},
      "rationale": "..."
    }
  }
}
```

### After (All Strategies):
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-06-10T10:30:00Z",
  "checkpoint_time": "10:30 ET",
  "recommendations": {
    "SPX": {
      "strategies": {
        "Butterfly": {
          "score": 65.0,
          "confidence": "MEDIUM",
          "should_trade": false,
          "rationale": "Low volatility environment..."
        },
        "Iron_Condor": {
          "score": 88.0,
          "confidence": "HIGH",
          "should_trade": true,
          "rationale": "Range-bound conditions..."
        },
        "Vertical": {
          "score": 45.0,
          "confidence": "LOW",
          "should_trade": false,
          "rationale": "Directional opportunity..."
        }
      },
      "best_strategy": "Iron_Condor",
      "market_conditions": {
        "iv_rank": 45,
        "range_expectation": 0.015,
        "gamma_environment": "Neutral"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Key Changes

1. **All Strategies Evaluated**: Every checkpoint evaluates Butterfly, Iron_Condor, and Vertical strategies
2. **Individual Confidence**: Each strategy gets its own confidence level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
3. **Trade Decision**: `should_trade` field indicates if this strategy should be executed
4. **Backward Compatible**: DiscordTrading integration supports both old and new formats

## How It Works

### For DiscordTrading:
- If scheduled to trade Butterfly at 10:30, check `strategies.Butterfly.should_trade`
- If scheduled to trade multiple strategies, check each one individually
- Only strategies with `should_trade: true` (HIGH confidence, score >= threshold) will execute

### Example Usage:
```python
# DiscordTrading can now check specific strategies
if recommendations["SPX"]["strategies"]["Butterfly"]["should_trade"]:
    # Execute Butterfly trade
    
if recommendations["SPX"]["strategies"]["Vertical"]["should_trade"]:
    # Execute Vertical trade
```

## Benefits

1. **Flexibility**: DiscordTrading can trade any combination of strategies
2. **Transparency**: See scores and confidence for all strategies, not just the best
3. **Better Control**: Each strategy evaluated independently
4. **Scheduling Freedom**: Can schedule different strategies at different times

## Configuration

No configuration changes needed. The system automatically:
- Evaluates all three strategies
- Sets HIGH confidence for scores >= 75
- Sets MEDIUM confidence for scores 50-74
- Sets LOW confidence for scores < 50
- Only marks `should_trade: true` for HIGH confidence with score >= min_threshold

## Monitor Output

When monitoring with `test_runner.py`, you'll now see:
```
üìä SPX recommendations:
  Butterfly: MEDIUM (65.0) - ‚è≠Ô∏è  SKIP
  Iron_Condor: HIGH (88.0) - ‚úÖ TRADE
  Vertical: LOW (45.0) - ‚è≠Ô∏è  SKIP
```

This makes it clear which strategies are approved for trading at each checkpoint.
