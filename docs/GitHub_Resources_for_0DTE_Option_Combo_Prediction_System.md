# GitHub Resources for 0DTE Option Combo Prediction System

## Executive Summary

After extensive research, I've identified several production-ready GitHub repositories and frameworks that provide the components needed for a 0DTE option combo prediction system similar to Magic8. The most promising combination includes **ib_async** for Interactive Brokers integration, **jensolson****/SPX-Gamma-Exposure** for gamma calculations, **aicheung****/0dte-trader** for 0DTE-specific strategies, and **py_vollib_vectorized** for high-performance Greeks calculations.

## Core Components for Gamma Exposure Analysis

## Production-Ready Gamma Exposure Calculators

**jensolson****/SPX-Gamma-Exposure** stands out as the most comprehensive solution with **124 stars and 48 forks**. This actively maintained Python repository calculates market maker gamma exposure using CBOE data and includes Black-Scholes Greeks calculations. [GitHub](https://github.com/jensolson/SPX-Gamma-Exposure/find/master)[GitHub](https://github.com/jensolson) It provides functions like CBOE_GEX() and CBOE_Greeks() with built-in sensitivity analysis across different spot prices. [GitHub +2](https://github.com/jensolson/SPX-Gamma-Exposure/blob/master/GEX.py)

**Matteo-Ferrara/****gex****-tracker** offers real-time CBOE data scraping with **118 stars and 42 forks**. It generates interactive visualizations and calculates GEX by strike and expiration, supporting multiple tickers including SPX and SPY with beautiful custom chart styling. [GitHub](https://github.com/Matteo-Ferrara/gex-tracker)[gex-tracker](https://matteo-ferrara.github.io/gex-tracker/)

For **GPU-accelerated performance**, the **OptionGreeksGPU** repository delivers exceptional speed, processing 1,648+ option contracts in just 0.14 seconds compared to 221 seconds for pure Python implementations - a 1,500x speedup critical for 0DTE analysis. [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/OptionGreeksGPU/)

## 0DTE-Specific Trading Systems

## Complete 0DTE Implementation

**aicheung****/0dte-trader** emerges as the most complete 0DTE-specific system on GitHub. This production-ready repository uses the Interactive Brokers API and supports all major option combos: Iron Condors, Iron Butterflies, Bull/Bear spreads, and Butterfly spreads. It includes automated order management with profit-taking and stop-loss mechanisms, plus retry logic for difficult fills. [GitHub +2](https://github.com/aicheung/0dte-trader)

## Comprehensive ****Backtesting**** Framework

**foxbupt****/****optopsy** provides a robust backtesting framework with **600+ stars**. It supports all the required strategies (Iron Condors, Iron Butterflies, Vertical Spreads) with modular filter-based construction and built-in optimization. The system is configurable for any DTE including same-day expiration. [GitHub](https://github.com/foxbupt/optopsy)[github](https://github.com/foxbupt/optopsy)

## Real-Time Data Integration

## Interactive Brokers Integration

**ib_async** (the maintained successor to ib_insync) provides the most robust Interactive Brokers integration. This asyncio-based framework offers real-time streaming with both sync/async patterns, production-ready error handling, auto-reconnection, and full support for option chains and streaming quotes. [GitHub +2](https://github.com/ib-api-reloaded/ib_async) It's ideal for implementing 5-minute update intervals.

## Alternative Data Sources

For those not using Interactive Brokers, **PyETrade** offers E*TRADE API integration with real-time quotes and option chains. [GitHub](https://github.com/jessecooper/pyetrade)[Etrade](https://developer.etrade.com/home) The **Python NSE Option Chain Analyzer** demonstrates continuous refresh capabilities with configurable intervals (default 1 minute) and includes alert systems with toast notifications.

## High-Performance Options Libraries

## Core Calculation Engines

**py_vollib_vectorized** provides the fastest implied volatility and Greeks calculations available. This vectorized extension of py_vollib offers 2.4x performance improvements and DataFrame integration, making it perfect for processing thousands of 0DTE contracts simultaneously. [github +3](https://github.com/vollib/py_vollib)

**QuantLib****-Python** serves as the industry standard for comprehensive derivatives pricing. It supports American options, exotic options, and volatility surfaces with professional-grade accuracy, though with more computational overhead than py_vollib. [Readthedocs +3](https://quantlib-python-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/termstructures/volatility.html)

## Strategy Visualization

**opstrat** excels at options strategy visualization with real-time Yahoo Finance integration. It creates payoff diagrams and supports complex multi-leg strategies, making it valuable for visualizing Iron Condors, Butterflies, and other combinations.

## Complete Trading Platforms

## Most Comprehensive Systems

**QuantConnect**** LEAN** represents the most mature complete system with **37,000+ stars**. Written in C#/.NET with Python algorithm support, it offers event-driven backtesting and live trading across multiple asset classes. It includes full options support with Greeks calculations and works with Interactive Brokers among other brokers. [github +2](https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean)

**NautilusTrader** provides a high-performance alternative with a Rust core and Python bindings. It's designed for production-grade algorithmic trading with nanosecond precision backtesting and is suitable for high-frequency trading scenarios.

## Machine Learning Components

## ML-Powered Strategy Selection

**mmfill****/iron-condor** implements advanced machine learning for Iron Condor strategy selection using feedforward and LSTM models. It predicts optimal strike prices using stationary time series analysis with four different approach combinations. [GitHub](https://github.com/mmfill/iron-condor)[github](https://github.com/mmfill/iron-condor)

**Options_Trading_ML** by nataliaburrey uses Logistic Regression and Multinomial models integrated with Yahoo Finance, Sentiment Investor, and Finta data for removing human bias from trading decisions. [GitHub](https://github.com/nataliaburrey/Options_Trading_ML)

## 0DTE Logic**: aicheung/0dte-trader as reference implementation [GitHub](https://github.com/aicheung/0dte-trader)

## Backtesting**: optopsy for strategy validation

## Supporting Libraries

## Visualization**: opstrat for strategy payoff diagrams [GitHub](https://github.com/hashABCD/opstrat)

## ML Enhancement**: adapt iron-condor LSTM approach for predictions

## Performance**: OptionGreeksGPU for GPU acceleration if needed

## Architecture Considerations

## Use event-driven architecture (following ib_async patterns)

## Implement 5-minute update cycles with async processing

## Store gamma exposure history for trend analysis

Combine multiple data points: gamma exposure, volume, open interest, and delta

## Key Implementation Tips

**Data Pipeline**: Most successful implementations use an event-driven architecture with separate threads for data collection, analysis, and order management. The ib_async framework provides excellent patterns for this approach. [GitHub +3](https://github.com/iagcl/data_pipeline)

**Performance Optimization**: For 0DTE trading where speed matters, consider using py_vollib_vectorized for batch Greeks calculations and potentially GPU acceleration for large-scale gamma exposure computations. [github](https://github.com/vollib/py_vollib)[Readthedocs](https://py-vollib-vectorized.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pkg_ref/iv.html)

**Risk Management**: The aicheung/0dte-trader repository demonstrates proper stop-loss and profit-taking automation, which is crucial for 0DTE strategies given their rapid time decay. [github](https://github.com/aicheung/0dte-trader)[GitHub](https://github.com/aicheung/0dte-trader)

**Testing Strategy**: Use optopsy's backtesting framework to validate strategies before live deployment, ensuring your gamma exposure signals and combo selections perform as expected historically.

These repositories provide all the necessary components to build a sophisticated 0DTE option combo prediction system. The combination of real-time data integration, advanced gamma exposure analysis, machine learning predictions, and automated execution creates a system comparable to or potentially exceeding Magic8's capabilities.
