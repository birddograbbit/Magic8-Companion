# IBKR Open Interest Fix Documentation

## Problem Description
The IBKR integration was failing to retrieve Open Interest (OI) data, returning NaN values that caused a `ValueError: cannot convert float NaN to integer` when processing option chains.

## Root Cause
The issue wasn't just about NaN handling - **IBKR doesn't provide Open Interest data in snapshot mode**. The API requires streaming with specific generic ticks (100 for call OI, 101 for put OI) to retrieve this data.

## Solution Overview
Based on the working reference script, we implemented a two-phase approach:

1. **Phase 1: Snapshot for Prices/Greeks**
   - Uses snapshot mode with generic ticks that work in snapshot (106-110 for Greeks, 104 for sizes)
   - Retrieves bid/ask prices, volumes, and Greeks quickly

2. **Phase 2: Streaming for Open Interest**
   - Briefly streams data with OI-specific generic ticks (100, 101)
   - Waits 2 seconds for OI data to populate
   - Maps OI data back to contracts

## Implementation Details

### Key Changes

1. **Added Generic Tick Constants**
```python
SNAPSHOT_GENERIC_TICKS = "106,107,108,109,110,13,104"  # Greeks, volumes, sizes
OI_GENERIC_TICKS = "100,101"  # Open Interest only
```

2. **New Streaming Method**
```python
async def _get_oi_streaming(self, contracts: List[Contract]) -> Dict[int, int]:
    """Get Open Interest data using streaming approach."""
    # Start streaming for all contracts
    # Wait for data to populate
    # Extract and return OI values
```

3. **Updated Option Chain Retrieval**
- First qualify all contracts
- Get OI data via streaming for all contracts at once
- Then get snapshot data for each contract individually
- Combine the results

### Benefits
- Properly retrieves real Open Interest data from IBKR
- More efficient than trying to get everything in snapshots
- Handles NaN values gracefully as a safety measure
- Works for both SPX and SPY options

## Testing
Run the test script to verify the fix:
```bash
python scripts/test_oi_streaming.py
```

Expected output:
- Should retrieve OI data for most strikes
- During market hours: expect non-zero OI values
- Outside market hours: OI data should still be available

## Files Changed
1. `magic8_companion/modules/ibkr_market_data.py` - Main implementation
2. `scripts/test_oi_streaming.py` - Test script for verification
3. `OI_STREAMING_FIX.md` - This documentation

## Notes
- The 2-second streaming timeout is configurable
- NaN handling is still included as a safety measure
- The fix maintains backward compatibility with the existing API
