# Magic8-Companion IBKR Integration Fixes Summary

## Date: June 11, 2025

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. NaN Volume Conversion Error ✅ FIXED

**Error**: `cannot convert float NaN to integer`

**Root Cause**: The IBKR API returns NaN for volume when:
- Trading outside regular hours
- No trading activity on specific options
- Data feed interruptions

**Fix Applied**: Added explicit NaN checking before integer conversion in `ibkr_market_data.py`:
```python
# Handle NaN values in volume
volume = ticker.volume
if volume is not None and not math.isnan(volume):
    strike_data['call_volume'] = int(volume)
else:
    strike_data['call_volume'] = 0
```

**Files Modified**:
- `magic8_companion/modules/ibkr_market_data.py` (lines ~464-490)

### 2. SPY Half-Dollar Strikes Missing ✅ FIXED

**Error**: `No security definition has been found for the request` for strikes like 587.5, 592.5, etc.

**Root Cause**: SPY options trade on multiple exchanges and some exchanges do not list half-dollar strikes.

**Fix Applied**: Added `qualify_contract_with_fallback` which retries qualification on
`SMART`, `CBOE`, `AMEX` and `ISE` until one succeeds.  The logs record the exchange that works for each strike.

## Test Results

### SPX: ✅ Working
- Successfully retrieves all option data
- NaN warnings fixed
- 51 strikes retrieved
- OI data working

### SPY: ✅ Working
- All strikes including half-dollar qualify using exchange fallback
- NaN warnings fixed

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Test the NaN fix
python scripts/test_nan_fix.py

# Test full functionality
python scripts/verify_spx_fix.py

# Test specific symbol
python scripts/test_ibkr_market_data.py SPY
```

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: The NaN conversion fix is complete and tested
2. **Completed**: Added SPY exchange fallback logic for half-dollar strikes
3. **Optional**: Add retry logic for failed strike qualification (extended monitoring)
4. **Cleanup**: Remove temporary test scripts (see TEMP_SCRIPTS_TRACKER.md)
