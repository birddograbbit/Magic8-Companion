# Magic8-Companion & DiscordTrading Integration Context

## Project Overview

You have two interconnected trading systems that work together:

### 1. Magic8-Companion (Analysis & Recommendations)
- **Repository**: https://github.com/birddograbbit/Magic8-Companion (main branch)
- **Purpose**: Analyzes market conditions and recommends optimal option strategies
- **Schedule**: Runs at checkpoints throughout the day (10:30, 11:00, 12:30, 14:45-15:55 ET)
- **Output**: Generates `data/recommendations.json` with strategy recommendations

### 2. DiscordTrading (Trade Execution)
- **Repository**: https://github.com/birddograbbit/DiscordTrading (dev branch)
- **Purpose**: Monitors Discord channels for trade signals and executes via Interactive Brokers
- **Integration**: Checks Magic8-Companion recommendations before executing trades
- **Feature**: Only executes trades with HIGH confidence recommendations

## Current Status

### Magic8-Companion (READY ✅)
- **Branch**: main (all features merged from dev-enhanced-indicators)
- **Features**:
  - Real-time market data from IBKR with Greeks
  - Enhanced indicators (GEX, Volume/OI analysis)
  - 18 checkpoints including every 5 minutes from 14:50-15:55
  - Supports SPX, SPY, QQQ, RUT
  - All IBKR fixes applied (NaN handling, SPY SMART routing)
- **Output Format**: Generates recommendations with preferred_strategy, score, and confidence levels

### DiscordTrading (INTEGRATION READY ✅)
- **Branch**: dev (has Magic8 integration built-in)
- **Integration File**: `magic8_integration.py` already exists
- **Config**: Has `magic8_companion` section in config.yaml
- **Logic**: Checks recommendations before executing trades

## Integration Architecture

```
1. Magic8-Companion runs on schedule (10:30, 11:00, etc.)
   ↓
2. Analyzes market conditions using IBKR data
   ↓
3. Outputs recommendations.json with confidence levels
   ↓
4. Discord trade signal arrives in channel
   ↓
5. DiscordTrading checks Magic8 recommendations
   ↓
6. If HIGH confidence + matching strategy → Execute
   Otherwise → Skip with log message
```

## Key Integration Points

### 1. Strategy Name Mapping
DiscordTrading maps Discord signal names to Magic8 strategies:
- "Sonar" → "Iron_Condor"
- "Butterfly" → "Butterfly"
- "Vertical" → "Vertical"
- "Call Spread"/"Put Spread" → "Vertical"

### 2. Decision Logic
- Only trades with `confidence: "HIGH"` proceed
- Strategy must match the recommendation
- Recommendations older than 5 minutes are ignored

### 3. Configuration
DiscordTrading config.yaml:
```yaml
magic8_companion:
  enabled: true  # Set to enable integration
  recommendations_path: "../Magic8-Companion/data/recommendations.json"
  max_recommendation_age: 300  # 5 minutes
```

## Testing Requirements

### 1. Verify Magic8-Companion Output
- Run Magic8-Companion and check that `data/recommendations.json` is created
- Ensure recommendations have HIGH confidence for some strategies
- Verify all symbols (SPX, SPY, QQQ, RUT) have recommendations

### 2. Test DiscordTrading Integration
- Enable magic8_companion in config.yaml
- Send test Discord signals that match HIGH confidence recommendations
- Send test signals that DON'T match recommendations (should be skipped)
- Check logs for proper Magic8 integration messages

### 3. End-to-End Testing
- Both systems running simultaneously
- Magic8-Companion generating fresh recommendations
- DiscordTrading receiving Discord signals
- Only HIGH confidence, matching strategies execute

## Configuration Files

### Magic8-Companion (.env)
```
M8C_USE_MOCK_DATA=false
M8C_USE_IBKR_DATA=true
M8C_CHECKPOINT_TIMES=["10:30", "11:00", "12:30", "14:45", "14:50", ...]
M8C_ENABLE_GREEKS=true
M8C_ENABLE_ADVANCED_GEX=true
```

### DiscordTrading (config.yaml)
```yaml
magic8_companion:
  enabled: true
  recommendations_path: "../Magic8-Companion/data/recommendations.json"
  max_recommendation_age: 300
```

## Integration Tasks

1. **Verify Current Setup**
   - Confirm Magic8-Companion generates proper JSON format
   - Test DiscordTrading can read the recommendations file
   - Verify path configuration is correct

2. **Test Integration Logic**
   - Test with magic8_companion.enabled: true
   - Verify trades are filtered based on recommendations
   - Check logging shows Magic8 decision reasoning

3. **Production Testing**
   - Run both systems during market hours
   - Monitor that recommendations update at checkpoints
   - Verify only HIGH confidence trades execute
   - Track skipped trades in logs

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update DiscordTrading README with Magic8 integration details
   - Add troubleshooting section for common integration issues
   - Document the decision flow with examples

## Known Issues & Fixes

### Magic8-Companion
- ✅ FIXED: NaN volume conversion errors
- ✅ FIXED: SPY half-dollar strikes with SMART routing
- ✅ FIXED: RuntimeWarning when running as module

### DiscordTrading
- ✅ FIXED: TradingConfig attribute error with Magic8 disabled
- ✅ FIXED: Multi-symbol support for RUT, etc.
- ✅ Has proper error handling for missing recommendation files

## Next Steps

1. **Enable Integration**: Set `magic8_companion.enabled: true` in DiscordTrading config
2. **Test Both Systems**: Run simultaneously and verify integration works
3. **Monitor Logs**: Check for Magic8 recommendation checks in DiscordTrading logs
4. **Fine-tune**: Adjust confidence thresholds and recommendation logic based on results

## Questions to Address

1. Should we allow MEDIUM confidence trades or only HIGH?
2. Should non-recommended trades be skipped entirely or executed with reduced size?
3. How should we handle when Magic8-Companion is down or recommendations are stale?
4. Should we add a manual override option for urgent trades?

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Magic8-Companion runs reliably at all checkpoints
- ✅ Recommendations are generated with proper confidence levels
- ✅ DiscordTrading successfully reads recommendations
- ✅ Only HIGH confidence + matching strategy trades execute
- ✅ Proper logging of all Magic8 decisions
- ✅ System handles edge cases gracefully
